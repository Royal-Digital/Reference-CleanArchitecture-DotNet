The dependency rule and trade offs
Balance between library isolation and not
Driving towards 'strict' implenetation 
Automapper cancer

Intro boundry projects
Put controllers into 'api' project and rename existing api to main

Reporting context
User bounded context

18-10-2017 Meeting
----------------------------------
1) Show Diagram vs Typical Diagram
 -> Go over flow of control and execution

2)Top down through code
 -> How controllers are tested
 -> Placement of interfaces

3) Usecases / Interactors
 -> Messages (Input/Output)
 -> Pushing BL from usecases to domain entities over time

4) Avoid services
 -> Push for DDD concepts instead

-----------Other points------------
1. Verticial Slicing simplicity
2. Code Agility 
 -> Technical detail v abstraction
3. Dependency Management
 -> Bleed of EF dependency
